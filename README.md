# UnipolarSequencer
Unipolar stepper motors sequencer library for Arduino, by Tennessee Carmel-Veilleux. 

See the [smarsbar robot repos](https://github.com/tcarmelveilleux/smarsbar/blob/master/src/smarsbar/smarsbar.ino) for a sample of use.

Install in your Arduino libraries folder. Code is portable and has been tested against Adafruit Feather M0 (ARM Cortex-M0-based, similar to Arduino Zero), Arduino Uno (AVR) and Adafruit Trinket (AVR).

**Full tutorial will come later if I have time :)**
